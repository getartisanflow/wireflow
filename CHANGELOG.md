# Changelog

## v0.2.1-alpha — 2026-04-14

### Added
- **AlpineFlow v0.2.1-alpha bundle** — includes Tier A measurement/layout lifecycle fixes, Tier B API additions (B1–B6), Tier C convenience/polish (C1–C4), D2 runState, and the workflow addon
- `flowSetNodeState(string|array $ids, string $state)` — sets `runState` on one or more nodes; auto-syncs server-side `$this->nodes` and dispatches `flow:setNodeState` to the client. Valid states: `pending`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`, `skipped`
- `flowResetStates()` — clears `runState` from all nodes; auto-syncs server-side `$this->nodes` and dispatches `flow:resetStates`
- `wireflow:install` now prompts for optional addons (workflow) via interactive multiselect. Non-interactive: `--no-interaction --with=workflow` for CI/AI agents
- Workflow addon bundle (`alpineflow-workflow.esm.js`) published alongside core — includes parallel branches, execution replay (`$flow.replayExecution()`), auto-skip, auto-reset, `$workflowRun` magic, `particleOptions`, and `.flow-edge-failed` CSS class
- `<x-flow-schema-node>` Blade component wrapping AlpineFlow's `x-flow-schema` directive. Renders database-schema-style nodes with per-row target/source handles keyed by field name. Supports an optional SSR fallback via `:label` + `:fields` props.
- `@connect-validate` event bridge — server-side async validation gate for new connections. Returns `bool` or `['allowed' => bool, 'reason' => string]`; edges only commit on allowance, with a default `flux-toast` on rejection-with-reason. Bridges to AlpineFlow's new `connectValidator` hook.

### Changed
- `flowAddNodes`, `flowRemoveNodes`, `flowAddEdges`, `flowRemoveEdges` now mutate server-side `$this->nodes` / `$this->edges` automatically, mirroring client-side cascade behavior. `flowRemoveNodes` cascade-removes descendants (via `parentId` chain) and connected edges. Fully backwards-compatible — components without public `$nodes`/`$edges` arrays skip the mutation and just dispatch

## v0.1.2-alpha — 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- Updated bundled AlpineFlow to v0.1.2-alpha — bundle no longer requires `alpinejs` as an external dependency
